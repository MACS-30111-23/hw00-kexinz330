* A summary and reflection of the Git/GitHub workflow you adopted for this homework, and of your experience with Markdown (e.g., provide a summary of the workflow you adopted, and add some comments about something new you learned, something that surprised you, etc.)
For the Git/Github workflow, I forked the repository, cloned it locally, made edits, committed changes, and pushed to GitHub.
Markdown simplifies text formatting with headers, emphasis, lists, images, and links. It's a practical tool for creating well-structured documentation.
